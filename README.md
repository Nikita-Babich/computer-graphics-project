# computer-graphics-project
Instead of using Qt I have decided to do the project with WinAPI. This way I speed up compilation time, reduce memory load, SIGNIFICANTLY reduce project size, avoid Visual Studio.

# Progress
- 04.03.2024 Decided to do this through WinAPI
- 07.03.2024 drawLine dda1 implemented
- 11.03.2024 translation, rotation, scaling, drawing out of window
